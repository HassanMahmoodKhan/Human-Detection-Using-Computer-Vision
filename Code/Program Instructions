Use this to run the code.
1) Please ensure Python 3 or a later version is installed.
2) Install/update required libraries i.e., pip install imutils, pip install cv2
3) Save the python file and the images folder to this path i.e. C:\Users\'Your name'.
 This is so because generally our softwares such as python files are stored here along with other library packages required. 
4) Open Command Prompt or Anaconda Prompt. I have employed the use of Argparse (command line parsing module in python lib), 
which issues commands directly to the command line allowing for greater flexibility without revisiting the code frequently.
5) Enter the following command "python detect.py --images images"
6) You should see the output of my project on the set of images included in the 'images' folder, with two output screens;
one depicting the image before non-mamximum suppression and one after.
